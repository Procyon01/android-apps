## Teaching myself Android

Herein is where I'm storing progress towards at least entry level proficiency in Android development.
I am currently following along in a MOOC put out by Tim Buchalka on Udemy, which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/android-marshmallow-java-app-development-course/learn/#/).

Each folder is a single standalone app developed in Android Studio.
